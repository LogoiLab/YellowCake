## PCBWay

PCBWay.com offers near identical technical abilities as JLCPCB.com. Where they differ is in pricing and special offers. Through PCBWay it is possible to get a discount if your project is open source. The catch to this is that they will determine the discount at time of purchase.

For our planned design PCBWay will charge the following:

$49 for board production.
$17 for shipping.
($66 total)

Production lead time: 12 hours
Production time: 48 hours
Shipping time: 2-4 days (highly variable sometimes as much as a week)

They take payment from all major cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex). They also accept payment from PayPal, AliPay, OKPay, and other popular online payment options.

We personally have seen discounts in the order of 10-15% off by "partnering with pcbway" on an open source project.
